Host a D&amp;D Session with Twitch Chat and TTS Voices!

ElevenLabs API is optional, but gives you access to several new voices.
Too add a new voice, copy its voice_id into the add menu after configuring your API key.

The free tier will work for testing purposes (locks us out of some fancy voices plus only has a 10k credit limit), but right now we hardcode a turbo model which is half credit usage since we don't need perfection.
